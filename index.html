                            <p>Internet of Things (IoT) in urban environments is frequently used to enhance infrastructure efficiency - e.g. carry more traffic over fewer roads. Little attention is paid to how urban IoT can enhance social outcomes.</p>
                            <p>Our research will prototype IoT solutions within a real-life public space in Melbourne to explore how IoT can enhance social connection and community resilience.</p>

                            <p>
                              Community resilience underpins liveability, collective well-being and economic competitiveness in our cities. Global urbanisation and the shift toward digital communities has the potential to increase isolation, social anonymity and disconnection. We need to consider how technology, placed into the urban environment (urban IoT), can facilitate social connection in our urbanising world.</p>

<p>IoT that is inserted into public spaces provides the perfect context for exploring how technology might promote social capital - promoting interactions between strangers in public spaces, facilitating community trust through joint ownership or care, or improving mental health in urban spaces.</p>

                              Our team has identified an underutilised and largely unknown public space, located in the increasingly dense inner urban area of Collingwood (Melbourne, Australia). The space is within the Collingwood Arts Precinct, a former technical college that will be developed into an arts and design community over the coming years. The space provides an opportunity to experiment and test IoT within a space that has few existing preconceptions but will be activated over the coming years. It has access to power and Internet, providing a technically feasible site for IoT deployment.

                            <p>This is research is important to Arup because it will:
                              <ol>
                                <li>Understand Arup’s place within the IoT ecosystem - are we an ideator at the concept stage, a system integrator/architect, an IoT data collector, product developer?</li>
                                <li>Develop skills in IoT deployment - connectivity, interaction design, physical UX design, platforms, data processing, architecture, limitations etc.</li>
                                <li>Develop relationships with groups in the IoT ecosystem, including <a href="http://rmit.edu.au" target="new">RMIT University</a> and <a href="http://www.wearesandpit.com" target="new">Sandpit</a>.</li>
                                <li>Develop inter-regional relationships within Arup between UKMEA (Digital Studio and Australasia (Planning, Digital)</li>
                                <li>Introduce and trial methods in design thinking and prototyping within Arup, that are under-utilised. This proposal is based around ‘learning by doing’ - observing (user experience research), trialling (building IoT quickly), testing (understanding usage), iterating (re-designing),  and sharing (being open - publishing code and video).</li>
                                <li>Trial new ways of working: leveraging our work through open-source communities (e.g. <a href="http://www.github.com" target="new">Github</a>), rather than only leveraging using financing.</li>
                              </ol>
                            </p>
                            <p>In the new digital economy, we define leverage differently. We will:
                              <ol>
                                <li>Leverage open source technology communities  - building upon existing open source code available on Github and similar, and publishing our code publicly on Github while in development - inviting any open-source IoT developer to contribute or critique code - improving the quality of our research substantially.</li>
                                <li>Partner with Collingwood Arts Precinct to provide access to a public space, introductions/access to stakeholders, and associated infrastructure required to deploy IoT (power, connectivity).</li>
                                <li>Explore opportunities to leverage funding with Australian Research Council grants, or RMIT research funding. This extra funding will allow for testing additional IoT concepts at the concept stage, and allow for further prototypes to be developed at the prototype testing stage.</li>

                            We'll update this website at every stage of the research. We'll openly host our code and technical architecture on Github - inviting the world to contribute to and derive value from our research.

                            We're going to develop three videos that show our initial concepts, to assist with user testing/research and make abstract ideas tangible, flushing out assumptions, dependencies and possibilities with more precision.

                            The final product will be a physical and technical prototype deployed into the real-world. We'll have designs and code ready to share.

                            We want to share our findings with an audience that doesn't normally read research reports. We'll use video to complement traditional reporting.<br></br>We'll develop a framework to help other parts of Arup understand where they sit within the urban IoT ecosystem
